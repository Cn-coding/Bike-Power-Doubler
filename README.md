# Bike-Power-Doubler
Simple python script to double power. Useful if you use a single sided power meter and the power needs doubling.
Only works for .gpx files, you can often download the .gpx files from Strava even if it isn't the original format.

1: Download the main.py file.
2: Make sure main.py and your .gpx file are in the same folder/directory.
3: Edit main.py so that the file name is the same as your .gpx file.
4: Run main.py
5: Your new .gpx file should have been created in the same directory with double power values.
